        <p><em><strong>Steamfitter by day, wanna be coder by night</strong></em></p>
        <p>I work construction by trade but looking to make the leap into coding full time.
          For the past 16 years I have worked on and off in various oil and gas refineries.
          I've recently became interested in coding and programing, so I've started taking courses.
          My goal is to become proficent enough to be able to switch careers and persue coding full time.</p>
